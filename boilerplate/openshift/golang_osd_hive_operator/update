=====================
THINGS YOU NEED TO DO
=====================
- Make sure the following line is in your base Makefile:

include boilerplate/$CONVENTION_NAME/includes.mk

- Remove any other 'include' lines, unless they're for things truly
  unique to your repository. (Otherwise, consider proposing them to
  boilerplate.)

- Delete any obsolete files you're no longer including.
